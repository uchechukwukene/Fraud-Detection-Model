# Fraud-Detection-Model
###Introduction
Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to financial businesses, leading to substantial financial losses and eroding customer trust. Traditional fraud detection methods often fall short in identifying complex fraud patterns, especially as fraudulent activities become more sophisticated. This project explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance fraud detection in credit card transactions, offering a novel approach that captures intricate relationships within transactional data.
